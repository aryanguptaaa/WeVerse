### **The project**

WeVerse provides users with a platform where they can enjoy their favorite movies and series.Users can also become creators and upload their own videos in the application for others to watch.Taking user's privacy into account WeVerse also provides the feature to upload the videos as private which prevents any access to the video other than the user themselves.The user can upvote or downvote the videos they watch as well.
<br>
<br>
Whenever a user wants to watch a specific video but does not know where or how to find it, the search feature comes into play.The dynamic search feature helps user find the video he/she's looking for.Also the playlist recommendation would help users to decide the next movies and series which he/she can binge next from his/her favorite genre.
<br>
<br>
The download feature enables user to download videos they might want to and users can also add videos to their favorites.Users can also associate with each other using the room feature of the application and experience the videos with their friends.
